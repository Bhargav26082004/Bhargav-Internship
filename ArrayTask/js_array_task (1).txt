1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum number in the array.

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the minimum number in the array.

3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements.

4. Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with elements in reverse order.

5. Write a function that checks if a given value exists in an array.

6. Write a function that counts how many times a specific element appears in an array.

7. Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array and returns a new array.

8. Write a function that returns the second largest number in an array.

9. Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

10. Write a function that rotates an array to the right by k positions.

11. Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0 to n, find the missing number.

12. Write a function that takes an array and a target sum and returns all pairs of numbers that add up to the target.

13. Given two arrays, return a new array containing elements that appear in both arrays (without duplicates).

14. Given an array of integers, find the first element that appears only once.

15. Implement a function to sort an array without using JavaScript’s built-in sort() method.

16. Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers.

17. Given an array of numbers, return an array where each element at index i is the product of all elements except the one at i, without using division.

18. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, rearrange it so that numbers alternate in sign while maintaining relative order.

19. Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum and return that sum.

20. Given an array, find the element that appears more than n/2 times (where n is the array length). Assume that such an element always exists.
